        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                This is a "fixation cross":
                <br><img src="Images/000_fixation-cross.png"/>
                <br>When this symbol appears, keep your eyes fixed on it. 
                </li>
            <li>Afterwards, you will briefly see pictures of people.
                <!--<br>Do not look away from the center of the screen while the pictures are on screen.
                <br>The person to be rated will be surrounded by a red border.
                <br>Only look at the person at the center of the screen.-->
            </li>
            <!--<li>Do not move your eyes, always keep looking at the "fixation cross" in the middle of the screen </li>-->
            <li>
                After each picture, you will be asked to intuitively rate the attractiveness of the person that is surrounded by a red border using a sliding scale like this: 
                <br><br><input type="range" min=0 max=100 value=50/>
                <br>
            </li>
            <!--<li>Move the slider <b>right</b> if you think the person was <b>attractive</b>.</li>
            <li>Move the slider <b>left</b> if you think the person was <b>not</b> attractive.</li>-->
            <li>After making a rating, click "continue" to see the next picture.</li>
            <!--<li>You will only see each picture for a fraction of a second, so try to stay as focussed as possible</li>-->
            <li>The experiment can be completed in under 30 minutes<!--, but we recommend planning for 30 minutes--><!--, but this depends on your speed-->. The experiment is divided into 5 blocks, you will have an opportunity to take a short break between each of the blocks. </li>
